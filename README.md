# Weekday Counters

Weekday Counters is an easy-to-use Hello World counter app for Android. It gives you a different counter for each day of the week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. You can increment or decrement the counter, reset its value back to zero, or share it by email, messengers, or in social networks.

"Hello World" programs are pretty famous, even if all they do is write "Hello World!" on the screen. When learning a new programming language or platform, starting with such a simple program has become a tradition.

Weekday Counters is built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), an open source framework for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.

## Contributing

Thank you for contributing! Weekday Counters is designed to be as simple and useless as possible, but you can still help with:

* testing and reporting bugs
* creating a nice icon to replace the [current one](android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png)
