# Weekday Counters

Weekday Counters is an easy to use counter app for Android. It gives you a different counter for each day of the week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. You can increment or decrement the counter, reset its value back to zero, or share it by email, messengers, or in social networks.

Weekday Counters is built with Flutter, Google's UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## Contributing

Thank you for contributing! Weekday Counters is designed to be as simple and useless as possible, but you can still help with:

* testing and reporting bugs
* creating a nice icon to replace the [current one](android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png)
